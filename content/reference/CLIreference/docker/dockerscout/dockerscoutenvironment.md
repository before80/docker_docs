# docker scout environment

| Description | Manage environments (experimental)               |
| :---------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Usage       | `docker scout environment [ENVIRONMENT] [IMAGE]` |
| Aliases     | `docker scout env`                               |

**Experimental**

**This command is experimental.**

Experimental features are intended for testing and feedback as their functionality or design may change between releases without warning or can be removed entirely in a future release.

## Description

The `docker scout environment` command lists the environments. If you pass an image reference, the image is recorded to the specified environment.

Once recorded, environments can be referred to by their name. For example, you can refer to the `production` environment with the `docker scout compare` command as follows:



```console
$ docker scout compare --to-env production
```
