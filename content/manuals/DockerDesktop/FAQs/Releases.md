# FAQs on Docker Desktop releases

### [How frequent will new releases be?](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/faqs/releases/#how-frequent-will-new-releases-be)

New releases are available roughly every month, unless there are critical fixes that need to be released sooner.

The **Automatically check for updates** setting in the **Software updates** tab is turned on by default. This means you receive notifications in the Docker menu and a notification badge on the Docker Dashboard when a new version is available.

You can also let Docker Desktop automatically download new updates in the background by selecting the **Always download updates** checkbox.

Sometimes new versions are rolled out gradually over a few days. Therefore, if you wait, it will turn up soon. Alternatively, you can select **Check for updates** in the Docker menu to get the latest version immediately.

This is managed through your IT administrator's endpoint management software.
