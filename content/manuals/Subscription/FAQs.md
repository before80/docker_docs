# Subscription FAQs

For more information on Docker subscriptions, see [Docker subscription overview](https://docs.docker.com/subscription/).

### [Can I transfer my subscription from one user or organization account to another?](https://docs.docker.com/subscription/faq/#can-i-transfer-my-subscription-from-one-user-or-organization-account-to-another)

Subscriptions are non-transferable.

### [Can I pause or delay my Docker subscription?](https://docs.docker.com/subscription/faq/#can-i-pause-or-delay-my-docker-subscription)

You can't pause or delay a subscription, but you can [downgrade](https://docs.docker.com/subscription/core-subscription/downgrade/). If a subscription invoice hasn't been paid on the due date, there's a 15 day grace period, including the due date.

### [Does Docker offer academic pricing?](https://docs.docker.com/subscription/faq/#does-docker-offer-academic-pricing)

Contact the [Docker Sales Team](https://www.docker.com/company/contact).

### [What ways can I contribute to Docker content?](https://docs.docker.com/subscription/faq/#what-ways-can-i-contribute-to-docker-content)

Docker offers two programs:

- [Docker-Sponsored Open Source Program (DSOS)](https://docs.docker.com/trusted-content/dsos-program/)
- [Docker Verified Publisher (DVP)](https://docs.docker.com/trusted-content/dvp-program/)

You can also join the [Developer Preview Program](https://www.docker.com/community/get-involved/developer-preview/) or sign up for early access programs for specific products to participate in research and try out new features.
