# Upgrade your subscription

When you upgrade to a paid subscription, you immediately have access to all the features and entitlements available in your new chosen subscription. For detailed information on features available in each subscription, see [Docker Pricing](https://www.docker.com/pricing).

> **Important**
>
> 
>
> Starting July 1, 2024, Docker will begin collecting sales tax on subscription fees in compliance with state regulations for customers in the United States. For our global customers subject to VAT, the implementation will start rolling out on July 1, 2024. Note that while the rollout begins on this date, VAT charges may not apply to all applicable subscriptions immediately.
>
> To ensure that tax assessments are correct, make sure that your [billing information]({{< ref "/manuals/Billing/DockerCore/Updatethebillinginformation" >}}) and VAT/Tax ID, if applicable, are updated. If you're exempt from sales tax, see [Register a tax certificate]({{< ref "/manuals/Billing/Registerataxcertificate" >}}).

## Upgrade your subscription

1. Sign in to [Docker Home](https://app.docker.com/).

2. Optional. If you're upgrading from a free user account to a Team subscription and want to keep your account name, [convert your user account into an organization]({{< ref "/manuals/Administration/Convertanaccountintoanorganization" >}}).

3. Select your **avatar** to expand the drop-down menu.

4. From the drop-down menu, select **Billing** and then the account you want to upgrade.

5. On the **Billing Details** tab, select **Change plan** and then choose the plan you'd like to upgrade to.

   > **Tip**
   >
   > 
   >
   > If your current plan is a free plan, select **Buy now**.

6. Follow the on-screen instructions.

   If you have a coupon to use, you can enter it during this step.
