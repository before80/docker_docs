# Docker Core subscriptions and features

> **Important**
>
> 
>
> Docker is introducing enhanced subscription plans. Our new plans are packed with more features, higher usage limits, and simplified pricing. The new subscription plans take effect at your next renewal date that occurs on or after November 15, 2024. No charges on Docker Hub image pulls or storage will be incurred between November 15, 2024, and January 31, 2025. See [Announcing Upgraded Docker Plans](https://www.docker.com/blog/november-2024-updated-plans-announcement/) for more details and learn how your usage fits into these updates.

You can do more with Docker with a Docker Core subscription, such as add collaborators, create scoped access tokens, and create private repositories. This page provides an overview of each subscription tier. To compare features available in each tier, see [Docker Pricing](https://www.docker.com/pricing/).

The following describes some of the key features included with your Docker Core subscription:
