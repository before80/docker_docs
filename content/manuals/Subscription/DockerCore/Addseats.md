# Add seats to your subscription

> **Important**
>
> 
>
> Starting July 1, 2024, Docker will begin collecting sales tax on subscription fees in compliance with state regulations for customers in the United States. For our global customers subject to VAT, the implementation will start rolling out on July 1, 2024. Note that while the rollout begins on this date, VAT charges may not apply to all applicable subscriptions immediately.
>
> To ensure that tax assessments are correct, make sure that your [billing information](https://docs.docker.com/billing/core-billing/details/) and VAT/Tax ID, if applicable, are updated. If you're exempt from sales tax, see [Register a tax certificate](https://docs.docker.com/billing/tax-certificate/).

You can add seats at anytime to your existing subscription.

When you add seats to your subscription in the middle of your billing cycle, you are charged a prorated amount for the additional seats.

> **Important**
>
> 
>
> If you have a [sales-assisted Docker Business subscription](https://docs.docker.com/subscription/core-subscription/details/#sales-assisted), contact your account manager to add seats to your subscription.

1. Sign in to [Docker Home](https://app.docker.com/).
2. Select your **avatar** to open the drop-down menu.
3. Select **Billing** from the drop-down menu and then **Add seats**.
4. Specify the number of seats you want to add. Your prorated fee is automatically calculated.
5. Select **Purchase** to confirm. The **Billing** tab displays the new number of seats.
6. Navigate to the **Members** tab to add new members. For more information, see [Manage organization members](https://docs.docker.com/admin/organization/members/).
