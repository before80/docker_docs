> Docker is introducing enhanced subscription plans. Our new plans are packed with more features, higher usage limits, and simplified pricing. The new subscription plans take effect at your next renewal date that occurs on or after November 15, 2024. No charges on Docker Hub image pulls or storage will be incurred between November 15, 2024, and January 31, 2025.
