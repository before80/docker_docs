# Manage seats and invites

You can add seats and manage invitations to your Docker Build Cloud Team in the Docker Build Cloud dashboard.

> **Note**
>
> 
>
> If you have a Docker Build Cloud Business subscription, you can add and remove seats by working with your account executive, then assign your purchased seats in the Docker Build Cloud dashboard.

## [Add seats](https://docs.docker.com/subscription/build-cloud/manage-seats/#add-seats)

1. Sign in to [Docker Build Cloud](https://build.docker.com/).
2. Select **Settings & billing**.
3. Under your current plan, select **Add seats**.
4. Select the number of seats you want to add, then select **Add seats**.

The number of seats will be charged to your payment information on file, and are added immediately.

## [Remove seats](https://docs.docker.com/subscription/build-cloud/manage-seats/#remove-seats)

1. Sign in to [Docker Build Cloud](https://build.docker.com/).
2. Select **Settings & billing**.
3. Under your current plan, select **Remove seats**.
4. Enter the total number of seats you want to keep on your plan, then select **Remove seats**.

The charge for the reduced seat count will be reflected on the next billing cycle. Optionally, you can cancel the seat downgrade any time before the next billing cycle.

## [Invite users](https://docs.docker.com/subscription/build-cloud/manage-seats/#invite-users)

As an owner of the Docker Build Cloud team, you can invite members to access cloud builders. To invite team members to your team in Docker Build Cloud:

1. Sign in to [Docker Build Cloud](https://build.docker.com/).
2. Select **User management**.
3. Select **Invite**.
4. Enter the email address or Docker ID of the member you want to invite. If the invitee doesn’t have a Docker ID yet, enter their email address so they can create an account when they accept the invite.
5. Select **Add**.

Invitees receive an email with instructions on how they can accept the invite. After they accept, the seat will be marked as **Allocated** in the **User management** section in the Docker Build Cloud dashboard.

For more information on the permissions granted to members, see [Roles and permissions](https://docs.docker.com/security/for-admins/roles-and-permissions#docker-build-cloud).
