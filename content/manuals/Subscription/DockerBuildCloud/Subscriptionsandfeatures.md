# Subscriptions and features

> **Important**
>
> 
>
> Docker is introducing enhanced subscription plans. Our new plans are packed with more features, higher usage limits, and simplified pricing. The new subscription plans take effect at your next renewal date that occurs on or after November 15, 2024. No charges on Docker Hub image pulls or storage will be incurred between November 15, 2024, and January 31, 2025. See [Announcing Upgraded Docker Plans](https://www.docker.com/blog/november-2024-updated-plans-announcement/) for more details and learn how your usage fits into these updates.

You can enhance your teams' builds with a Build Cloud subscription. This page describes the features available for the different subscription tiers. To compare features available for each tier, see [Docker Build Cloud pricing](https://www.docker.com/products/build-cloud/#pricing).

## Docker Build Cloud Starter

If you have an existing [Docker Core subscription]({{< ref "/manuals/Subscription/DockerCore/Subscriptionsandfeatures" >}}), a base level of Build Cloud minutes and cache are included. The features available vary depending on your Docker Core subscription tier.

### Docker Personal

- 50 build minutes every month
- Available for one user
- 1 parallel build

### Docker Pro

- 100 build minutes every month
- Available for one user
- 4 parallel builds

### Docker Team

- 400 build minutes every month shared across your organization
- Option to onboard up to 100 members
- Can buy additional seats to add more minutes

### Docker Business

- All the features listed for Docker Team
- 800 build minutes every month shared across your organization

## Docker Build Cloud Team

You can buy Docker Build Cloud Team if you don’t have a Docker Core subscription, or upgrade any Docker Core tier to enhance your developers' experience with the following features:

- 200 additional build minutes per seat
- Option to buy reserve minutes
- Increased shared cache

The Docker Build Cloud Team subscription is tied to a Docker [organization]({{< ref "/manuals/Administration/Organizationadministration" >}}). To use the build minutes or shared cache of a Docker Build Cloud Team subscription, users must be a part of the organization associated with the subscription. See Manage seats and invites.

To learn how to buy this subscription for your Docker organization, see [Buy your subscription - existing account or organization]({{< ref "/manuals/Billing/DockerBuildCloud#existing-account-or-organization" >}}).

If you haven’t created a Docker organization yet and don’t have an existing Docker Core subscription, see [Buy your subscription - new organization]({{< ref "/manuals/Billing/DockerBuildCloud#new-organization" >}}). For organizations without a Docker Core subscription, this plan also includes 50 shared minutes in addition to the Docker Build Cloud Team minutes.

## Docker Build Cloud Enterprise
