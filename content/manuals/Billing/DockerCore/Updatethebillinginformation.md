# Update the billing information

> **Important**
>
> 
>
> Starting July 1, 2024, Docker will begin collecting sales tax on subscription fees in compliance with state regulations for customers in the United States. For our global customers subject to VAT, the implementation will start rolling out on July 1, 2024. Note that while the rollout begins on this date, VAT charges may not apply to all applicable subscriptions immediately.
>
> To ensure that tax assessments are correct, make sure that your [billing information](https://docs.docker.com/billing/core-billing/details/) and VAT/Tax ID, if applicable, are updated. If you're exempt from sales tax, see [Register a tax certificate](https://docs.docker.com/billing/tax-certificate/).

You can update the billing information for your personal account or for an organization. When you update your billing information, these changes apply to future billing invoices.

> **Important**
>
> 
>
> You can't update an existing invoice, including paid and unpaid invoices.

The billing information provided appears on all your billing invoices. The email address provided is where Docker sends all invoices and other [billing-related communication](https://docs.docker.com/billing/core-billing/details/#update-your-email-address-that-receives-billing-invoices).
