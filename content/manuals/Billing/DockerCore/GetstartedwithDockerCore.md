# Get started with Docker Core

> **Important**
>
> 
>
> Docker is introducing enhanced subscription plans. Our new plans are packed with more features, higher usage limits, and simplified pricing. The new subscription plans take effect at your next renewal date that occurs on or after November 15, 2024. No charges on Docker Hub image pulls or storage will be incurred between November 15, 2024, and January 31, 2025. See [Announcing Upgraded Docker Plans](https://www.docker.com/blog/november-2024-updated-plans-announcement/) for more details and learn how your usage fits into these updates.

Docker Core subscriptions offer features and benefits to support both new and professional developers, as well as plans for individuals, teams, and enterprise businesses. To learn more about what's included with each tier, see [Docker Core subscriptions and features]({{< ref "/manuals/Subscription/DockerCore/Subscriptionsandfeatures" >}}) and [Docker Pricing](https://www.docker.com/pricing/).

In this section, learn how to get started with a Docker Core subscription for individuals or for organizations. Before you begin, make sure you have a [Docker ID]({{< ref "/manuals/Dockeraccounts/Createanaccount" >}}).

> **Important**
>
> 
>
> Starting July 1, 2024, Docker will begin collecting sales tax on subscription fees in compliance with state regulations for customers in the United States. For our global customers subject to VAT, the implementation will start rolling out on July 1, 2024. Note that while the rollout begins on this date, VAT charges may not apply to all applicable subscriptions immediately.
>
> To ensure that tax assessments are correct, make sure that your [billing information]({{< ref "/manuals/Billing/DockerCore/Updatethebillinginformation" >}}) and VAT/Tax ID, if applicable, are updated. If you're exempt from sales tax, see [Register a tax certificate]({{< ref "/manuals/Billing/Registerataxcertificate" >}}).
