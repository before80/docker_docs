# Register a tax certificate

If you're a customer in the United States and you're exempt from sales tax, you can register a valid tax exemption certificate with Docker's Support team. If you're a global customer subject to VAT, make sure that you provide your [VAT number](https://docs.docker.com/billing/core-billing/history/#include-your-vat-number-on-your-invoice).

> **Important**
>
> 
>
> Starting July 1, 2024, Docker will begin collecting sales tax on subscription fees in compliance with state regulations for customers in the United States. For our global customers subject to VAT, the implementation will start rolling out on July 1, 2024. Note that while the rollout begins on this date, VAT charges may not apply to all applicable subscriptions immediately.
>
> To ensure that tax assessments are correct, make sure that your [billing information](https://docs.docker.com/billing/core-billing/details/) and VAT/Tax ID, if applicable, are updated. If you're exempt from sales tax, see [Register a tax certificate](https://docs.docker.com/billing/tax-certificate/).

1. Your customer name matches the name on the exemption certificate
2. Your tax exemption certificate specifies Docker Inc as the Seller or Vendor and all applicable information is filled out
3. Your certificate is signed and dated, and the expiration date hasn't passed
4. You have a valid Docker ID/namespace(s) of the accounts that you want to apply the tax exemption certificate to
