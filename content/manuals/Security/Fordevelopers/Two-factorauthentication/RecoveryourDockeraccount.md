# Recover your Docker account

If you have lost access to both your two-factor authentication application and your recovery code:

1. Sign in to your [Docker account](https://app.docker.com/login) with your username and password.
2. Select **I've lost my authentication device** and **I've lost my recovery code**.
3. Complete the [Contact Support form](https://hub.docker.com/support/contact/?category=2fa-lockout). You must enter the primary email address associated with your Docker ID in the **Contact Support** form for recovery instructions.
