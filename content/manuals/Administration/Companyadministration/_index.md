# Company administration

A company provides a single point of visibility across multiple organizations. This view simplifies the management of Docker organizations and settings. Organization owners with a Docker Business subscription can create a company and then manage it through the [Docker Admin Console](https://app.docker.com/admin).

The following diagram depicts the setup of a company and how it relates to associated organizations.
