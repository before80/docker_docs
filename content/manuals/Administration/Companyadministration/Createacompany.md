# Create a company

You can create a new company in the Docker Admin Console. Before you begin, make sure you're the owner of the organization you want to add to the new company. The organization also needs to have a Docker Business subscription.

**Early Access**

The Docker Admin Console is an [early access]({{< ref "/manuals/Releaselifecycle#early-access-ea" >}}) product.

It's available to all company owners and organization owners. You can still manage organizations in Docker Hub, but the Admin Console includes company-level management and enhanced features for organization management.

## Create a company

To create a new company:

1. In the Admin Console, navigate to the organization you want to place under a company. The organization must have a Business subscription, and you must be an owner of the organization.

2. Under **Organization settings**, select **Company management**.

3. Select **Create a company**.

4. Enter a unique name for your company, then select **Continue**.

   > **Tip**
   >
   > 
   >
   > The name for your company can't be the same as an existing user, organization, or company namespace.

5. Review the company migration details and then select **Create company**.

For more information on how you can add organizations to your company, see [Add organizations to a company](https://docs.docker.com/admin/company/organizations/#add-organizations-to-a-company).
