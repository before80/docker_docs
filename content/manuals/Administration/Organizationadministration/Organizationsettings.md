# Organization settings

**Early Access**

The Docker Admin Console is an [early access](https://docs.docker.com/release-lifecycle#early-access-ea) product.

It's available to all company owners and organization owners. You can still manage organizations in Docker Hub, but the Admin Console includes company-level management and enhanced features for organization management.

This section describes how to manage organization settings in the Docker Admin Console.

## [Configure general information](https://docs.docker.com/admin/organization/general-settings/#configure-general-information)

General organization information appears on your organization landing page in Docker Hub.

This information includes:

- Organization Name
- Company
- Location
- Website
- Avatar

To edit this information:

1. Sign in to the [Admin Console](https://admin.docker.com/).
2. In the left navigation, select your organization in the drop-down menu.
3. Under **Organization settings**, select **General**.
4. Specify the organization information and select **Save**.

## [Next steps](https://docs.docker.com/admin/organization/general-settings/#next-steps)

In the **Organization settings** menu, you can also [configure SSO](https://docs.docker.com/security/for-admins/single-sign-on/configure/) and [set up SCIM](https://docs.docker.com/security/for-admins/provisioning/scim/). If your organization isn't part of a company, from here you can also [audit your domains](https://docs.docker.com/security/for-admins/domain-audit/) or [create a company](https://docs.docker.com/admin/company/new-company/).
