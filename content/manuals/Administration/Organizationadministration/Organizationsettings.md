# Organization settings

**Early Access**

The Docker Admin Console is an [early access]({{< ref "/manuals/Releaselifecycle#early-access-ea" >}}) product.

It's available to all company owners and organization owners. You can still manage organizations in Docker Hub, but the Admin Console includes company-level management and enhanced features for organization management.

This section describes how to manage organization settings in the Docker Admin Console.

## Configure general information

General organization information appears on your organization landing page in Docker Hub.

This information includes:

- Organization Name
- Company
- Location
- Website
- Avatar

To edit this information:

1. Sign in to the [Admin Console](https://admin.docker.com/).
2. In the left navigation, select your organization in the drop-down menu.
3. Under **Organization settings**, select **General**.
4. Specify the organization information and select **Save**.

## Next steps

In the **Organization settings** menu, you can also [configure SSO]({{< ref "/manuals/Security/Foradmins/Singlesign-on/Configure" >}}) and [set up SCIM]({{< ref "/manuals/Security/Foradmins/Provisioning/SCIM" >}}). If your organization isn't part of a company, from here you can also [audit your domains]({{< ref "/manuals/Security/Foradmins/Domainaudit" >}}) or [create a company]({{< ref "/manuals/Administration/Companyadministration/Createacompany" >}}).
