# Docker account overview

You can create a Docker account to secure a Docker ID, which is a username for your account that lets you access Docker products. You can use your Docker account to sign in to Docker products like Docker Hub, Docker Desktop, or Docker Scout. You can centrally manage your [Docker account settings](https://app.docker.com/settings), as well as account security features, in [Docker Home](https://app.docker.com/).
