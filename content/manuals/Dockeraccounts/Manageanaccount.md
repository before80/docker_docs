# Manage an account

You can centrally manage the settings for your Docker account. Here you can also take administrative actions for your account and manage your account security.

> **Tip**
>
> 
>
> If your account is associated with an organization that enforces single sign-on (SSO), you may not have permissions to update your account settings. You need to contact your administrator to update your settings.

## [Update general settings](https://docs.docker.com/accounts/manage-account/#update-general-settings)

1. Sign in to your [Docker account](https://app.docker.com/login).
2. In Docker Home, select your avatar in the top-right corner to open the drop-down.
3. Select **Account settings**.

From here, you can take any of the following actions.

### [Update account information](https://docs.docker.com/accounts/manage-account/#update-account-information)

To update your account information, select the arrow icon. You can edit the following settings here:

This information is visible on your account profile in Docker Hub.

Make your changes here, then select **Save** to save your settings.

To update your email address, select the arrow icon.
